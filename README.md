# Introduction


## Contents

 This repository contains all the programming work that I completed during my 4th year of studies (2024-2025) at Polytech Clermont.
 
 The root of this repository contains all the necessary git files/folders, along with **1 folder for each of my courses**.



## Virtual environment specifications

 For each course where I programmed in Python, I created a virtual environment.  
 *The names of these virtual environments are usually prefixed by "env" and followed by the corresponding course's label.*
 
 Due to repository storage space limitations, I decided to include these environments in the *.gitignore* file.  
 As a result, it is necessary to initialize these environments and install required libraries (using *requirements.txt* files) after clonijng this  
 repository.




# COURSE DESCRIPTIONS


## BDD (Base de données / Database)

* Study of relational databases
* Study of relational algebra
* SQL queries
* Study of semantic web
* SPARQL queries



## C++ (and UML)

* Learning C++ programming
* Oriented-Object programming (OOP)
* UML courses (class diagrams, sequence diagrams, etc.)
* Introduction to QT Creator



## Deep Learning

During this course, we are deeply studying Deep Neural Networks after covering the basics of Machine learning & Optimization last year.  
To implement neural networks, we primarly use the Keras library (built on TensorFlow).



### Main AI methods studied :
* Model & Sequential classes
* K-fold validation
* Grid search
* Transfer learning (using pre-trained models)
* Natural Langage Processing : Tokenization, embedding, etc.



### Main AI models studied :
* Multiple inputs and multiple outputs network
* Residual networks (ResNet)
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
* Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
* Transformers



## Java (and C#)

* Learning Java and C# programming



## Machine learning 2

This course is a continuation of last year' Machine learning course.  
* Clustering (Hierarchical Clustering, K-means, EM algorithm, etc.)
* Theorical approach to Neural Networks



## Méthodes numériques et simulation (Numerical Methods and Simulation)

* Theorical mathematics (distributions, Hilbert spaces, test functions, etc.)
* Solving differential equations
* Implementation of numerical schemes (Python)



## Power BI (Cloud Computing)

* Introduction to Cloud Computing (with a focus on Microsoft Azure)
* Introduction to Data Visualization using Power BI



## Python

Advanced Python programming:  
* Oriented-Object programming (OOP)
* Study of graph theory applied to Python (network graphs, shortest path algorithms, etc.)
* Exploration of Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, NetworkX, etc.)



## Régression linéaire (Linear regression)

Programming using the R langage.

* Linear regression
* Logistic regression
* ANOVA
